## Full Description:

Track app performance and user happiness for all your web apps in
real-time using NewRelic RPM and Airbrake. Now with Heroku… NewRelic
RPM is an awesome analytics / monitoring service for server side
developers, dev-ops folks, and network engineers, and Airbrake
(formerly Hoptoad) from Thoughtbot is a killer way to manage exception
notifications for your Rails apps. The problem is that each is only
as good as YOU are at watching them all day long, and they can flood
your inbox with emails — not cool.

Now, with NewRelic + Airbrake for Google Chrome™, you can get up
to the second app performance stats from your API or web application,
without leaving Hacker News (or whatever else you're browsing).

This extension uses an HTTPS connection to connect to NewRelic's
API and display your apps' performance metrics, and will display
real-time Chrome notifications when your application has a production
exception. Monitor up to 10 apps at once.

NewRelic RPM can monitor of apps built with Django, Erlang, Java,
Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rails, Scala, hosted on Apache, Hadoop,
MongoDB, MySQL databases, Nginx, Node.js, Unicorn, and Phusion
Passenger web application servers.

UPDATE 2012-01-02: Now refactored to reflect Hoptoad's new name,
Airbrake.

UPDATE 2011-06-01: Now available in Japanese! Just make sure your
default OS language is set to Japanese and everything will work.

UPDATE 2011-05-20: Now supports Heroku NewRelic accounts.

UPDATE 2011-05-05: Now, get real-time error notifications directly
within the extension as Chrome notifications. No more cluttered
inbox!

UPDATE 2011-03-27: We now display your Apdex score [1] over the
extension icon, so you don't even need to click to see your app's
status. Sweet!
